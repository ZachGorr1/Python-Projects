# Python-Projects

Here are some projects i've coded in Python for my Scripting Languages class 2830C.

Graphics = In this code, i was asked to work on and change elements within Pythons built in graphics library. It took me sometime to figure it out but i feel i have a good handle on this feature now.

Ring Toss = In this code i had to build a project based on another students idea. The student i chose had the idea of a ring toss game, bassed on parameters the student gave me. I built out this small ring toss game that would let the user throw a ring, and based on chance of random number generator would tell the user if they one a Small, Medium, or Large prize.

Space Game = In this code, i wanted to challenge myself and learn a new aspect of Python. So in Pygame i followed along instructions to create a custom game. It is a two player game where you control a spaceship that fires lasers at your opponet. You have 10 lives last to live wins, this project took me about 3 hours to build out and have up and running. It taught me a lot about the possibilites pygame has to offer, and how to get key input from users.
